# microcontroller_LED_pj
To understand the microcontroller pin toggling a simple circuit is designed. 
In the circuitry all the pins of port P2 are toggled with LEDs.
A program uploaded in microcontroller that instructs the microcontroller to ON and OFF the LEDs one by one with some delay.
Circuit design done in Proteus software and for program Keil-ÂµVision is used.
